MODELING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THETA-GAMMA COUPLING TO SEQUENTIAL MEMORY, IMAGINATION, AND DREAMING: Pirazzini and Ursino, Frontiers in Neural Circuits, 2024. 


GENERAL README FILE

This repository contains three different folders, each containing codes for simulating the episodic memory model described in article 'MODELING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THETA-GAMMA COUPLING TO SEQUENTIAL MEMORY, IMAGINATION, AND DREAMING: Pirazzini and Ursino, Frontiers in Neural Circuits, 2024' (https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2024.1326609). 

The Encoding) folder contains the codes for training the model.
 
The Retrieval) folder contains codes for testing the retrieval of previously learned temporal sequences.

The folder Isolation from the external world) contains codes for testing different behaviors of the network in special cases when the network is isolated from the environment.

More details are contained in the README files within the three folders, and as comments to the lines of code in the various scripts. The model was implemented exclusively in the MATLAB environment.
