MODELING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THETA-GAMMA COUPLING TO SEQUENTIAL MEMORY, IMAGINATION, AND DREAMING: Pirazzini and Ursino, Frontiers in Neural Circuits, 2024. 

README FILE relative to the folder 'Encoding'

The present folder contains three different MATLAB scripts, and two different '.mat' files.

'MAIN_training_L1' is the main script for training the network ('Encoding' operation mode), and can call the other two scripts depending on whether you want to train orthogonal or nonorthogonal (i.e., shared) sequences.

Two test trainings have already been performed, and the synapses already saved within the '.mat' files ('synapses_ORTHO' & 'synapses_SHARED')
