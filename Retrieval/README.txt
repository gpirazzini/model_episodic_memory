MODELING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THETA-GAMMA COUPLING TO SEQUENTIAL MEMORY, IMAGINATION, AND DREAMING: Pirazzini and Ursino, Frontiers in Neural Circuits, 2024. 

The present folder contains three different MATLAB scripts.

'MAIN_retrieval_ortho' & 'MAIN_retrieval_shared' are the two main scripts for test the 'retrieval' functioning mode of the network (you can use one or the other depending on the type of sequences you want to retrieve), and both call the same script 'RETRIEVAL_sim'.
