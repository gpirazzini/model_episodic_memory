MODELING THE CONTRIBUTION OF THETA-GAMMA COUPLING TO SEQUENTIAL MEMORY, IMAGINATION, AND DREAMING: Pirazzini and Ursino, Frontiers in Neural Circuits, 2024. 

README FILE relative to the folder 'Isolation from the external world'

The present folder contains two different MATLAB scripts.

'MAIN_isolation_shared' is the main script for test the 'Isolation from the external world' operation mode of the network, and call the script 'ISOLATION_sim'.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Please note 1: in this folder %comments to the scripts are more sparse; this is because they have already been inserted in the other scripts (scripts in the folders 'Encoding' and 'Retrieval')

**Please note 2: for all details omitted here, please refer to the reference article: https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2024.1326609
